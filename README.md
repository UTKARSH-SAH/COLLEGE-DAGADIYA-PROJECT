1.	Why I choose this project?
I choose this project because when I started my learning process a lot of time was wasted while surfing on the internet in search of relevant and complete content of different subjects of a professional course and to overcome this problem I started working on this project to solve this problem which was faced by other students also.It gives me the opportunity to help students persuing any professional course by providing relevant content at one place to save surfing time over the internet. This project help me to showcase my web development skills.

2.	How is my project better than other projects?
My project is better than other projects in the same field as till date no one is providing all the content related to a professional course subjects at one place over the internet, apart from that I believe that every project should be encouraged and everyone works hard towards their project.
